        <h2>Dubai | United Arab Emirates</h2>

            Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/, doo-BY; Arabic: دبي, romanized: Dubayy, IPA: [dʊˈbajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation:
            [dəˈbaj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of
            Dubai, the most populated of the country's seven emirates.[7][8][9]
            Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew into a regional trading hub in the
            early 20th century and grew rapidly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and
            luxury.[10] It has the second-most five-star hotels in the world[11] and boasts the tallest building in the
            world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717 ft) tall.[12]
            In the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian Gulf,[13] it is a major global transport hub
            for passengers and cargo.[14] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a
            major mercantile hub.<br><br>
            Dubai has been a center for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, and its economy
            relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.[15][16][17][18] Oil
            production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018. The city has a population of around
            3.60 million (as of 2022).[20]
            The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex. It
            points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, and even as
            far afield as the Levant.[24] Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al
            Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid[25] show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit
            periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the
            Sumerians as Magan and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.[26]
            The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the
            city's present coastline.[27] Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries.[28] Prior
            to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar).[28] After
            the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world conquered south-east
            Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah)
            found several artefacts from the Umayyad period.[29]
            An early mention of Dubai in 1095 is in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah
            al-Bakri.[citation needed] The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned
            Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry.<br><br>
            Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century[30] and was, by
            1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin
            Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.[31] In 1822, a British naval surveyor noted that Dubai was at that time populated
            with a thousand people living in an oval-shaped town surrounded by a mud wall, scattered with goats and
            camels. The main footpath out of the village led to a reedy creek while another trailed off into the desert
            which merged into caravan routes.[32]: 17 
            In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established
            themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became
            joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktoum to establish the Maktoum dynasty.[30]
